[root@training ~]# puppet resource package
[root@training ~]# puppet resource host

1. Create a new manifest file called motd.pp:

vim motd.pp

2. In that file create a class named motd that will manage the /etc/motd file in a given state.

3. The file resource that your class contains might look similar to:

file { '/etc/motd':
  ensure  => file,
  owner   => 'root',
  group   => 'root',
  content => 'Hello world! Puppet is awesome.',
}
4. Run puppet parser validate motd.pp to validate your syntax.

5. Apply your manifest with puppet apply motd.pp. Notice that no changes were made. Why is that?

6.Add the line include motd to the end of your manifest and apply it again. Can you explain why you saw the results you did?
